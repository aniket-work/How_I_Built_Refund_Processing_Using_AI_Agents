# Tutorial: Setting Up and Running AI Agent Powered Refund Processing System

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- A basic understanding of virtual environments and command-line tools.

## Steps

1. **Virtual Environment Setup:**
   - Create a dedicated virtual environment for our project:
   
     ```bash
     python -m venv How_I_Built_Refund_Processing_Using_AI_Agents
     ```
   - Activate the environment:
   
     - Windows:
       ```bash
       How_I_Built_Refund_Processing_Using_AI_Agents\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - Unix/macOS:
       ```bash
       source How_I_Built_Refund_Processing_Using_AI_Agents/bin/activate
       ```

2. **Install Project Dependencies:**

   - Navigate to your project directory and install required packages using `pip`:
   
     ```bash
        
     cd path/to/your/project
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run - AI Agent Powered Refund Processing System**

   Finally, execute the following command to start the "AI Agent Powered Refund Processing System" application:

   ```bash 
   # generate synthetic cases of our Law Firm
   python app.py
    ```
